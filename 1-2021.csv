3/1/21; 1:30; still investigating how other software draw complicated roofs
4/1/21; 0:40; define the algorithm for creating gable roof
5/1/21; 1:25; investigating the way to find intersection of two lines
6/1/21; 3:0; writing the functions for intersection lines point, finding the coordinate of interioer points
7/1/21; 5:20; Implementation the code of gable line
8/1/21; 1:20; Implementing Gui of gable lines"
9/1/21; 4:45; work on creating multi level roof, thus try to creating negative slope for edges
10/1/21; 5:25; creating primitive model of two level roof, add negative slop for roof
11/1/21; 1:20; trying to create a two level roof with our tools, not succeed
12/1/21; 1:45; remove bugs in creating gable, adding convert gable and negative edges to slope
